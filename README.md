# CSD: ChillGuy, Pack a Suitcase, and Center a Div

Welcome to **CSD** (ChillGuy, Pack a Suitcase, Center a Div), a fun and interactive web project that combines humor and creativity through different mini-games. This project includes three main sections:

## 1. **ChillGuy - The Energy Quiz**
Test your knowledge in a quirky energy quiz!

In this section, you'll have to pack the worst possible suitcase:
- Click buttons to pack random items like a shirt, a cactus, and a pillow into a suitcase.
